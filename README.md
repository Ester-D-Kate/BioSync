# BioSync

BioSync is a comprehensive project that integrates IoT hardware, eye-tracking technology, and a full-stack web application for biometric synchronization and analysis.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main directories:

### `iot/`
This directory contains all the code necessary to run and control the hardware components of the BioSync system. It includes scripts, configurations, and firmware for interacting with IoT devices.

### `backend-eyetracker/`
This directory houses the backend code specifically for the eye-tracker functionality and other IoT-related backend services. It handles data processing, communication with IoT devices, and provides APIs for eye-tracking data.

### `app/`
This is a monorepo directory that contains both the frontend and backend components of the main application:

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, providing a modern web interface for users to interact with BioSync features.
- **Backend**: Includes server-side logic with AI capabilities, authentication, and other advanced features.

The `app/` directory uses a monorepo structure with tools like Turbo for efficient development and deployment.
